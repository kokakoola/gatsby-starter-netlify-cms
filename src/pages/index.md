  title: What to expect from a rehomed Shiba Inu
  description: >-
    I got Hiro 2,5 years ago. He was a giveaway as his owner saw him unhappy and
    understood it does not work out. 
description: >-
  I knew he is anxious and does not like traffic. But this multitude of
  misbehaving was not what I expected: first the very special shiba
  characteristic spiced with delayed socialising and missing basic training.

        Shibas are ancient native breed. Besides cuteness it means they have to
        be socialised early, before 16 weeks. Their basic character how to cope
        with stress during lifetime develops between 8-12 months. 


        My Hiro was adopted at 16 months, he is from a farm and lived in a big
        cosy cage and never met a city and had little interaction with humans.
