As his owner was a strong man he never bothered to teach Hiro some basics on leash. 

As shibas are not large he had learned some tricks to get what he wants: one quick strong pull out of blue can be very efficient. For example break my finger on pulling down from bike. Or just looking stupid on street. 

In a while the dragging will make him pant as he gets no air even with harness.
